      "written" : "PlayKids-XD is an open-world social game in which you can create an avatar, decorate a home, interact with other players, and visit their houses. Start a new game with PK-XD and the first thing you'll do is create your custom character. This game has a colorful, almost otherworldly aesthetic, and has loads of character creation options.  Once you create a character, you can start decorating your house, which has three rooms and a hallway.  Many of the basic items for your house are free, so you can create a great home without spending much of the in-game currency. That being said, as you play you can earn money and buy furniture, clothes, accessories and other unique items to create a complete custom character and home, which you can edit at any point during the game.  But there's more than just your home in PK-XD, there's an entire online world to explore.  Visit other player's homes, chat with them, stroll around the city, buy food, go to parties, and much, much more. Much like games such as Hotel Habbo, most of PK-XD gameplay revolves around customization and interaction with other players."

(You might get free furniture but not gems) And collecting fruits in the Juice Factory 3 times will give you a surprise box. -Drink a power up to get to the top of the Juice Factory."
